    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">The goal of the Rich Context project is to
        create a new platform that enables the search and discovery of
        datasets.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">The challenge that empirical researchers face
        is that it is very difficult to find out, for a given dataset, who has
        worked with the data before, what methods were used, what was produced,
        and where those products can be found. Addressing that lack of
        information consumes an enormous amount of time and energy for many
        social scientists. A platform that provided automated tools and services
        to improve search and discovery could greatly facilitate the
        process—often by passively capitalizing on the accumulated labor of
        one’s extended research community.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">There now exists the scientific capacity to
        build such a platform.  There is a burgeoning scientific field of
        knowledge databases which provide a natural representation for
        scientific hypotheses in many domains. Manually curated ontologies and
        knowledge graphs are central to many scientific processes in domains
        such as biomedical research. The existing knowledge bases cover just a
        small fraction of the findings that are reported in the scientific
        literature. The field is developing automated approaches to accelerate
        the development of these resources.  In particular, the scientific
        underpinnings necessary to build the automated approaches include: (i)
        document corpus development, (ii) ontology development for dataset
        entity classification, (iii) natural language processing and machine
        learning models for dataset entity extraction, (iv) graph models for
        improving search and discovery, and (v) engagement to get scientists to
        contribute code and knowledge. A forthcoming SAGE publications book
        <strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/richcontextbook-update">
        https://tinyurl.com/richcontextbook-update</a></strong> provides an overview of
        initial work in each area. </p><br />

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>Our first step</strong> in developing a model was
        hosting our first <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition">competition</a></strong>
        in which we asked participants around the globe to develop named entity
        recognition models that would identify and extract dataset mentions from
        full-text social science publications.  Twenty teams from across the
        world submitted letters of intent; four finalist teams presented their
        models in New York in February 2019.  Their <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">
        papers and presentations can be viewed here</a></strong>; The Allen
        Institute for Artificial Intelligence were
        the winners of the competition.

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>The first application of the rich
        context work is our Data Stewardship module</strong>, which enables data
        owners and stewards to manage permissions and access to their datasets.
        Metadata from this module will interact with Rich Context - for example,
        information on usage of the datasets, results from analyses using them,
        and linkage of datasets with other pieces of data will emerge from the
        Data Stewardship model and be used to enrich the knowledge graph
        conveying relationships in the Rich Context Module.

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>Our book on this subject, to be
        published in November 2019</strong>, gives an in-depth background on use
        cases for the Rich Context, development of models and the training data
        they rely on, background on ontology and knowledge-graph, and the
        technical and cultural considerations around creating tools for
        development of metadata and sustained engagement with the research
        community.

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">We also are working on <strong>developing a
        better training corpus for our next competition</strong> and
        <strong>implementing a knowledge graph to develop better
        recommendations</strong>. We’re using existing, known connections
        between datasets and research publications to build out a structure for
        the knowledge graph that will be the basis of our Rich Context Explorer.
