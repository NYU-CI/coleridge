- I just wanted to say THANK YOU so much for having me on as a student in the Applied Data Analytics course! You all set up such a nice session one, treated us so well, & I could not be more thrilled and humbled to be surrounded by such bright and enthusiastic fellow students and instructors. Very much looking forward to future sessions and getting our hands dirty with our project. See you soon!
- Love the Jupyter notebooks!! ... I love how the code snippets and explanations are set up in the Jupyter notebooks. The format of going through it individually and discussing questions/challenges in your group, with the experts available when needed, worked really well for my learning style.
- Thinking about using machine learning for predic ng who could most bene t from a program was really great. In the social service world we do not o en think about predic ons but I could see this being helpful in my day-to-day work. I've also started using python for data analysis/cleaning and really appreciate its  exibility.
