    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">The goal of the Rich Context project is to create a new platform 
        that enables the search and discovery of datasets. The <strong>challenge</strong> that empirical researchers 
        face is that it is very difficult to find out, for a given dataset, <strong>who</strong> has worked with the 
        data before, <strong>what methods</strong> were used, <strong>what results</strong> were produced, 
        and <strong>where</strong> those products can be found. Addressing that lack of information consumes an 
        enormous amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A platform that provided automated tools and 
        services to improve search and discovery could greatly facilitate the process—often by passively capitalizing on 
        the accumulated labor of one’s extended research community.
      </p>
      
      <p class="comp-description">There now exists the scientific capacity to
        build such a platform, and interest from the scholarly community, whose participation and contribution to this project are vital, 
        as this is necessarily a community-based project.<br />
      </p>  

      <p class="comp-description">We are approaching this project from four areas:<br /><br />
        1.  Knolwedge graph and corpus development<br />
        2.  Community engagement<br />
        3.  Graph models for improving search and discovery<br />
        4.

        1.  Rich Context Competition<br /><br />
        We are hosting a competition that prompts NLP/ML researchers around the world to developing models that can 
        automatically detect which datasets were used in research publications. Using our knowledge graph, we provide 
        a corpus with validated linkages between datasets and publications, plus their metadata. We have a leaderboard 
        to track teams' progress. The competition is open to the public! <br /><br />
        2.  Building Technical Infrastructure<br /><br />
        a)  Knowledge graph<br />
        b)  Corpus development<br />
        c)  <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/richcontext-scholapi/">
          richcontext-scholapi</a></strong><br />
        We've developed a library of API calls for metadata discovery and exchange across multiple scholarly 
        infrastructure providers. We use Note that even in cases where there is good coverage for the published research 
        in a particular field, these APIs do not provide the same coverage – such that one must “mix & match” results. 
        To-date there is no one discovery service for searching the links among datasets, publications, people, topics, etc., 
        in general.<br /><br />
        
        2.  Community Engagement<br /><br />
        a)  Competition<br />
        We have an active community of researchers working on models for automated dataset detection in research publications.
          In addition to building their own models, teams are contributing to shared tools for pdf retrieval and text extraction.<br />

        here is a burgeoning scientific field of
        knowledge databases which provide a natural representation for
        scientific hypotheses in many domains. Manually curated ontologies and
        knowledge graphs are central to many scientific processes in domains
        such as biomedical research. The existing knowledge bases cover just a
        small fraction of the findings that are reported in the scientific
        literature. The field is developing automated approaches to accelerate
        the development of these resources.  In particular, the scientific
        underpinnings necessary to build the automated approaches include: (i)
        document corpus development, (ii) ontology development for dataset
        entity classification, (iii) natural language processing and machine
        learning models for dataset entity extraction, (iv) graph models for
        improving search and discovery, and (v) engagement to get scientists to
        contribute code and knowledge. A forthcoming SAGE publications book
        <strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/richcontextbook-update">
        https://tinyurl.com/richcontextbook-update</a></strong> provides an overview of
        initial work in each area. </p><br />

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>Our first step</strong> in developing a model was
        hosting our first <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition">competition</a></strong>
        in which we asked participants around the globe to develop named entity
        recognition models that would identify and extract dataset mentions from
        full-text social science publications.  Twenty teams from across the
        world submitted letters of intent; four finalist teams presented their
        models in New York in February 2019.  Their <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">
        papers and presentations can be viewed here</a></strong>; The Allen

        the winners of the competition.

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>The first application of the rich
        context work is our Data Stewardship module</strong>, which enables data
        owners and stewards to manage permissions and access to their datasets.
        Metadata from this module will interact with Rich Context - for example,
        information on usage of the datasets, results from analyses using them,
        and linkage of datasets with other pieces of data will emerge from the
        Data Stewardship model and be used to enrich the knowledge graph
        conveying relationships in the Rich Context Module.
