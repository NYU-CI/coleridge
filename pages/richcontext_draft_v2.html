    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">The goal of the Rich Context project is to create a new platform 
        that enables the search and discovery of datasets.<br><br>The <strong>challenge</strong> that empirical researchers 
        face - It is very difficult to find out, for a given dataset:
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>Who</strong> has worked with the data before;</li>
          <li><strong>What methods</strong> were used;</li>
          <li><strong>What results</strong> were produced;</li>
          <li>and, <strong>Where</strong> those products can be found.</li>
        </ol><br></div>
        <p class="comp-description">Addressing that lack of information consumes an 
            enormous amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A platform that provided automated tools and 
            services to improve search and discovery could greatly facilitate the process — often by passively capitalizing on 
            the accumulated labor of one’s extended research community. </p>
        
      <p class="comp-description">There now exists the scientific capacity to
        build such a platform, and interest from the scholarly community, whose participation and contribution to this project are vital, 
        as this is necessarily a community-based project. </p><br />

       <strong> Python Library:</strong> We've built a library <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/richcontext-scholapi/">
          richcontext-scholapi</a></strong> which provides API integrations for federating discovery services and metadata exchange across multiple scholarly infrastructure providers. 
          We regularly expand and develop the library by integrating additional APIs.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">
        <strong> Knowledge Graph and Competition:</strong> We're creating a corpus of known links between research publications and datasets, which emerge from the  <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/richcontext-scholapi/">
            knowledge graph</a></strong> we are building. 
            Using the corpus, we designed a <strong><a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">
            competition</a></strong> inviting NLP researchers to develop models to automatically detect dataset usage from research publications. 
            The competition is open to the public and ongoing, with team progress is tracked on a leaderboard.
            Our competition makes use of open source tools like <a href="https://github.com/allenai/spv2">
            science-parse</a> from Semantic Scholar. </p>

              Project Jupyter</a></strong>
              to create extensions which treat datasets as top-level constructs. Features like  <strong> <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5548">

              and Commenting </a></strong> enable users to register datasets within research projects; browse metadata on their datasets while they work; and comment and collaborate in real-time on
              shared projects and datasets. Ongoing work involves enriching our knowledge graph with information gleaned from comments, collaboration and computing within the Jupyter environment; and developing a reccomendation engine
              for datasets and code.

        hosting our first <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition">competition</a></strong>
        in which we asked participants around the globe to develop named entity
        recognition models that would identify and extract dataset mentions from
        full-text social science publications.  Twenty teams from across the
        world submitted letters of intent; four finalist teams presented their
        models in New York in February 2019.  Their <strong><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">

      <p class="comp-description"><strong>The first application of the rich
        context work is our Data Stewardship module</strong>, which enables data
        owners and stewards to manage permissions and access to their datasets.
        Metadata from this module will interact with Rich Context - for example,
        information on usage of the datasets, results from analyses using them,
        and linkage of datasets with other pieces of data will emerge from the
        Data Stewardship model and be used to enrich the knowledge graph
        conveying relationships in the Rich Context Module.

        they rely on, background on ontology and knowledge-graph, and the
        technical and cultural considerations around creating tools for
