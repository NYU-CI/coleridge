    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">Researchers and analysts who want to use data for evidence and policy cannot easily find out <strong>who</strong> else worked with the data, on <strong>what topics</strong> and with <strong>what results</strong>. As a result, good research is underused, great data go undiscovered and are undervalued, and time and resources are wasted redoing empirical work.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">We want you to help us develop and identify the best text analysis and machine learning techniques to discover relationships between data sets, researchers, publications, research methods, and fields. We will use the results to create a rich context for empirical research – and build new metrics to describe data use.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">This challenge is the first step in that discovery process.</p>

      <p class="comp-heading" id="competitiongoal">COMPETITION GOAL</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">The goal of this competition is to automate the discovery of research datasets and the associated research methods and fields in social science research publications. Participants should use any combination of machine learning and data analysis methods to identify the datasets used in a corpus of social science publications and infer both the scientific methods and fields used in the analysis and the research fields.</p>

      <p class="comp-heading" id="competitionspecifics">COMPETITION SPECIFICS</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">The competition has two phases (details below).</p>
      <p class="comp-description">
        <strong>First Phase:</strong> You will be provided la listing of datasets and a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications with an additional dev fold of 100 publications. Each publication will be labeled to indicate which of the datasets from our list are referenced within and what specific text is used to refer to each dataset. You can use this data to train and tune your algorithms to detect mentions of data in publication text and, when a data set in our list is mentioned, tie each mention to the appropriate data set. A separate corpus of 5,000 labeled publications will be held back and serve as an evaluation corpus against which we will run submitted models and use the results to evaluate your submissions. Before final submission, you will be able to submit a model for test validation against this evaluation corpus up to 2 times. On final submission, you will primarily be scored on the accuracy of your techniques, the quality of your documentation and code, and the efficiency of the algorithm – and also on your ability to infer methods and research fields used in each of the publications.</p>
      <p class="comp-description">
        <strong>Second Phase:</strong> Up to five teams will be asked to participate in the second phase. If selected, you will be provided with a large corpus of unlabeled publications and asked to discover which of the datasets were used in each publication as well as the associated research methods and fields. As in the first phase, you will be scored on the accuracy of your techniques, the quality of your documentation and code, and the efficiency of the algorithm – and also on your ability to infer methods and research fields in the associated passage retrieval.</p>
      <p class="comp-description">Teams reaching the second phase will be awarded a prize of $2,000 and economy-class travel costs for one participant to the finalist workshop in New York City. A stipend of $20,000 will be awarded to the winning team; the winning team will work with the sponsors in the subsequent implementation of the algorithm.</p>
      <p class="comp-description">All submitted algorithms will be made publicly available as open source tools.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="comp-description">Our long range goal is to transform the empirical foundation of social and health sciences research. We are building a computational research platform, the <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/assets/docs/adrf_summary.pdf" target="_blank">NYU Administrative Data Research Facility</a>, and working in collaboration with <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam" target="_blank">SAGE Publications</a>, <a href="https://www.digital-science.com" target="_blank">Digital Science</a>, and <a href="http://jupyter.org" target="_blank">Project Jupyter</a> to do so.</p>
      <p class="comp-description">Our eventual goal is to build a set of tools for this platform that enable collaborative knowledge creation and discovery with confidential microdata. We propose to accomplish this through working with the research community to create rich contextual metadata about the data sets: Jupyter notebooks with analysis and code, user-created annotations, and machine-learned relationships from publications about the methods used and fields studies by researchers using the datasets.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">Accepted participants will be given access to a github repository that contains a DockerFile and related resources, including starting materials. For your submission, you will update the DockerFile and other files in a branch of this repository to install needed software or libraries and include a command line program that will run any set of publications through the team’s model that conforms to an API so it can be plugged in to automated means of evaluating the model post-submission. The program will accept standard input and create standard output of which datasets are mentioned, which mentions refer to data sets in our list, and which research fields and research methods are described in the provided texts. Detailed specifications for this docker container and the program to process articles will be provided to participants.
