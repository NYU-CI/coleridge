        The <strong>Administrative Data Research Facility</strong> (ADRF) provides a secure platform to host confidential micro-data. The ADRF system has been granted FedRAMP moderate pre-authorization and is designed to scale to different amounts and types of use. The ADRF is not just a single configuration of computing resources.  Instead, it provides a set of data analysis components that can be combined in different ways, within the secure ADRF boundary, to meet a wide range of analytical needs. From traditional statistical analysis of data, to configurations that could be used to combine heterogeneous data. This technical flexibility, combined with our user, project, and data set management tools, allow for a given instance of the ADRF to securely and nimbly serve diverse data, analytical, and security needs.

                    <p class="feature-description">The ADRF FedRAMP security procedures are documented in a 400 page system security plan submitted to the Census Bureau.  Security is implemented in three layers: Cloud infrastructure, operational security and application layer security. After reviewing our completed FedRAMP pre-Readiness Assessment, the Census Bureau has provided the ADRF system with an Authority to Test.   We expect Provisional FedRAMP approval by August 2017 and full FedRAMP approval by September 2017.</p>
