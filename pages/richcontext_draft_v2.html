          The goal of the Rich Context project is to create a new platform that 
          enables the search and discovery of datasets.
          <br><br>

          The <strong>challenge</strong> that empirical researchers face is that, 
          for a given dataset, it is difficult to find out <strong>who</strong> has 
          worked with the data before, <strong>what methods and code</strong> were used, 
          and <strong>what results were produced</strong>. Some <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9">
            estimates</a> suggest that more 
          than a third of analysts’ time is spent in finding out about data 
          rather than in model development and production, and the <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/action-plan/">
            Federal Data Strategy</a> has directed government agencies to streamline access 
          to federal data assets. 
          <br><br>
          There now exists the scientific capacity to build a platform that 
          will automate search and discovery. 
          A <strong><a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">competition</a></strong>
          brought together computer scientists from around the globe to develop models that would identify 
          and extract dataset mentions from full-text publications. The finalists convened in New York City 
          in February 2019 to present their <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">work</a>.  
          A follow on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/rcworkshop_report">workshop</a> brought together more than 70 international experts to identify gaps and an 
          operational roadmap.

        <ol>
            <li>A Python library <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/richcontext-scholapi/">
              richcontext-scholapi</a></strong> which provides API integrations for federating discovery services and metadata exchange across multiple scholarly infrastructure providers. The library is constantly integrating additional APIs.</li>
            <li>A <strong>knowledge graph</strong> of known links between datasets, research publications, researchers and experts, and projects within the social sciences. </li>
            <li>A <strong><a href="https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/rclc">leaderboard competition </a></strong> inviting NLP research teams to develop models to automatically detect dataset usage from the text of research publications. Teams are also contributing to shared tools for pdf retrieval and text extraction. The competition is open to the public.</li>
            <li>A set of Jupyter extensions which treat datasets as top-level constructs. Features like the <strong><a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5548">
              Data Registry</a></strong>,  <strong><a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-metadata-service/blob/master/press_release.md">
