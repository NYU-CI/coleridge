The curriculum draws on best practices from both industry and government, including adherence to strict federal requirements on security and confidentiality. Skills taught include data linkage, visualization, and machine learning at a level accessible and useful for data novices and computer experts alike. Participants will be grouped in to teams of 5 or fewer people to design and conduct a research project using the IRI scanner data."
