      <p class="comp-description">The goal of the Rich Context project is to create a new platform 
        that enables the search and discovery of datasets.<br><br>The <strong>challenge</strong> that empirical researchers 
        face - It is very difficult to find out, for a given dataset:
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>Who</strong> has worked with the data before;</li>
          <li><strong>What methods</strong> were used;</li>
          <li><strong>What results</strong> were produced;</li>
          <li>and, <strong>Where</strong> those products can be found.</li>
        </ol><br></div>
        <p class="comp-description">Addressing that lack of information consumes an 
            enormous amount of time and energy for many social scientists. A platform that provided automated tools and 
            services to improve search and discovery could greatly facilitate the process — often by passively capitalizing on 
            the accumulated labor of one’s extended research community. </p>
        
      <p class="comp-description">There now exists the scientific capacity to
        build such a platform, and interest from the scholarly community, whose participation and contribution to this project are vital, 
        as this is necessarily a community-based project. </p><br />

       <strong> Python Library:</strong> We've built a library <strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/richcontext-scholapi/">
          richcontext-scholapi</a></strong> which provides API integrations for federating discovery services and metadata exchange across multiple scholarly infrastructure providers. 
          We regularly expand and develop the library by integrating additional APIs.</p>

      <p class="comp-description">
        <strong> Knowledge Graph:</strong> We're creating a <strong><a href="https://github.com/NYU-CI/RCGraph">
          knowledge graph</a></strong> knowledge graph of known links between datasets, research publications, researchers and experts, and projects within the social sciences. The knowledge graph is the source of
          all rich context metadata. 
        
        </p>
    <p class="comp-description">
        <strong> Competition:</strong> Using our knowledge graph, we created a corpus of known links between research publications and datasets.
            Using the corpus, we designed a <strong><a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">
            competition</a></strong> inviting NLP researchers to develop models to automatically detect dataset usage from the text of research publications. 
            The competition is open to the public and ongoing, with team progress is tracked on a leaderboard.
            Our competition makes use of open source tools like <a href="https://github.com/allenai/spv2">
            science-parse</a> from Semantic Scholar. </p>

            <strong> Jupyter Extensions:</strong> We've collaborated with <strong><a href="https://jupyter.org/">
              Project Jupyter</a></strong>
              to create extensions which treat datasets as top-level constructs. Features like  <strong> <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/5548">
              the Data Registry</a></strong>, <strong> <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-metadata-service/blob/master/press_release.md">
              the Metadata Explorer</a></strong>, and <strong> <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-commenting/blob/master/press_release.md">
              Commenting </a></strong> enable users to register datasets within research projects; browse metadata on their datasets while they work; and comment and collaborate in real-time on
              shared projects and datasets. Ongoing work involves enriching our knowledge graph with information gleaned from comments, collaboration and computing within the Jupyter environment; and developing a reccomendation engine
              for datasets and code.

          <strong> Competition:</strong> We've collaborated with an active community of researchers working on models for automated dataset detection in research

          <strong>Human-In-The-Loop:</strong> We've partened with RePEc (Research Papers in Economics), a repository of economics research 
          with a lively and engaged community of contributors. RePEc's unique interface enables authors to validate and contribute metadata on research. 
          With a sample of RePEc's contributors, we are piloting a program where contributors will validate outputs from the 
          machine learning models that arae developed during the competition.
