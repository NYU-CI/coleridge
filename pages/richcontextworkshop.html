        The focus of the Rich Context workshop is to build a scientific basis
        for the empirical foundations of data science in government. Empirical
        research relies critically on knowing how data has been produced and
        used before: the required elements include what does the data <strong>measure</strong>,
        what <strong>research</strong> has been done by which <strong>researchers</strong>,
        with what <strong>code</strong>, and with what <strong>results</strong>.
        The interest of funders in supporting data science, combined with the
        recent passage of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_for_Evidence-Based_Policymaking_Act" target="_blank">Evidence-Based Policymaking Act</a></strong>
        and the launch of the <strong><a href="https://strategy.data.gov/" target="_blank">federal data strategy</a></strong>,
        make this an opportune time for such a workshop.

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p class="curriculum-description">
        We expect the outcomes of the workshop to be:<br />
        1. A roadmap that will identify the opportunities, gaps, and necessary investments.<br />
        2. The development of an interdisciplinary community of computer scientists,
        life scientists, and social scientists who can work together to address the problems.<br />
        3. The engagement of key stakeholders, notably funding agencies, and government agencies.<br />

        Share your work with us—in a Lightning Talk that lasts exactly five minutes. We’re looking for a concise presentation, with or without slides, on a topic of your choice--current research or projects, a work-in-progress, an idea you'd love to find collaborators for, or a lesson learned. Interested? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14HA9G_cjX9CasAs0UmLxevzF9hFIJ8SVQweB-gGPOEI/edit" target="_blank">Submit</a> a talk proposal at before Monday, October 7. We’ll notify you by Friday, October 18, and if your talk was chosen then you’ll need to provide slides by Monday, November 11. We’ll have three half-hour Lightning Talks sessions during the Rich Context Workshop.

        There is substantial interest in building an empirical basis for
        evidence-based policy. Doing so involves learning what data have been
        used by which experts to examine which topics, building better search
        and discovery tools for finding those datasets and experts, and building
        a platform that will both improve tools and disseminate the knowledge
        to both the scientific and policy making community.

        There now exists the technical capacity to build such a platform, as
        demonstrated by a successful recent <strong><a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">competition</a></strong>.
        Computer scientists and domain experts in the life sciences have
        developed the scientific underpinnings necessary to build each
        component: document corpus development, ontology development for dataset
        entity classification, natural language processing and machine learning
        models for dataset entity extraction, graph models for improving search
        and discovery, telemetry to capture dataset engagement and use.
        This workshop will bring together scientists who are working at the
        cutting edge of knowledge in each of these areas, policy makers who are
        in need of the results of their work, and funding agencies who have
        historically supported these efforts.

        Paco Nathan, Derwen.ai; Ian Mulvany, SAGE publications;
        Christine Borgman, UCLA; and Waleed Ammar, Allen Institute for
        Artificial Intelligence. The workshop will be convened as an
        unconference in the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp" target="_blank">“Foo Camp” style</a></strong>.

        Most of the focus for this work centers on complex data governance for
        data science workflows involving sensitive data in regulated
        environments. We believe that current efforts in open source projects
        are contributing to much improved dataset modeling and knowledge graph
        applications for these purposes.
